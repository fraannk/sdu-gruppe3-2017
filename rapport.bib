  abstract      = {Digital Signal Processing, Second Edition enables electrical engineers and technicians in the fields of biomedical, computer, and electronics engineering to master the essential fundamentals of DSP principles and practice. Many instructive worked examples are used to illustrate the material, and the use of mathematics is minimized for easier grasp of concepts. As such, this title is also useful to undergraduates in electrical engineering, and as a reference for science students and practicing engineers},
